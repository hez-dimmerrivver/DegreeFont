# Degree Font
## Degree Font is a generative and interactive font visualizing global temperature change
## Concept
*°Font is a project that combines and reimagines weather forecasting and variable font
platforms. Like people check the daily temperature, this platform allows users to
explore annual global temperature changes. The project also employs a generative font
system that visually responds to temperature variations. When users select a specific
month and year, the temperature value appears in a font resembling tree branches. As
the temperature increases, the branches gradually wither and begin to burn,
symbolizing the impact of rising global temperatures and wildfires.*
##Technology Used
*This project was made with P5.js and the inatallation made with Arduino Mega Board*
