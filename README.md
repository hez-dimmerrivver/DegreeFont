# DEGREE FONT
## Short Description
°Font is a project that combines and reimagines weather forecasting and variable font platforms. Like people check the daily temperature, this platform allows users to explore annual global temperature changes. The project also employs a generative font system that visually responds to temperature variations. When users select a specific month and year, the temperature value appears in a font resembling tree branches. As the temperature increases, the branches gradually wither and begin to burn, symbolizing the impact of rising global temperatures and wildfires.
